# 🐶😺 Cat vs Dog Classifier (SVM + HOG + Streamlit)

This project is a machine learning app built with **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of cats and dogs. It uses **HOG features** for image recognition and a **Streamlit UI** for uploading and predicting images.

---

## 💡 Features

- Classifies images as "Cat" or "Dog"
- Uses SVM trained on 4000+ images
- Extracts HOG features
- Upload images through Streamlit
- Clean and styled interface

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image
- Streamlit
- PIL (Pillow)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure `svm_hog_cat_dog_model.pkl` is in the same folder.
3. Install required libraries:
